This repository contains the MATLAB scripts and data files used towards the completion of the ENG-SCI 100 capstone project entitled "An On-line Algorithm for Battery Characterization and Parameter Estimation." This repository contains:
* the completed first, second, and third iterations of the project build
* scripts for each of the experiments (as described in the project report) conducted on each of the build iterations


The scripts are designed so that any user can perform any of the experiments simply by calling the associated script.
